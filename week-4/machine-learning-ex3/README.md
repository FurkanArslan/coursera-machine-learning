# Week 4 - Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks

`This week contains some informations and notations about Neural Network in entry level` 

You can learn briefly:
 * what is neural networks, 
 * which problems can we use neural networks,
 * model representation of neural networks (Which is called neuron model),
 * what is activation unit,
 * what is hidden unit, where can we use it,
 * represantation of 'and', 'or' and 'xor' logistic units with Neural Networks
