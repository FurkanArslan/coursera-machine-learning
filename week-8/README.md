# Week 8 - K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis

`This week contains informations about unsupervised learning and clustering` 

 While supervised learning algorithms need labeled examples (x,y), unsupervised learning algorithms need only the input (x). I learnt about clustering which is used for market segmentation, text summarization, among many other applications.
 
 This week is also mention about Principal Components Analysis, which is used to speed up learning algorithms, and is sometimes incredibly useful for visualizing and helping you to understand your data.
